## Environment setup

its pretty easy to setup Environment. there are two things need to do

1. Install jdk
2. Install eclipse

### 1. install jdk:

installing jdk is pretty easy if your debian configured to repository. Run following commands, if you are using ubuntu OS

	sudo apt install default-jdk

### validation

	varma@varma:~/Documents/GitHub/BigDataLearning$ java --version
	openjdk 11.0.1 2018-10-16
	OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.1+13-Ubuntu-2ubuntu1)
	OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.1+13-Ubuntu-2ubuntu1, mixed mode, sharing)
	varma@varma:~/Documents/GitHub/BigDataLearning$ 

### 2. install eclipse

It is pretty easy as ubuntu software center provides eclipse installer directly. open ubuntu software center, search for it and click on install. 

# Journey to learn JAVA

There are two main tasks have to perform in Java, not like python.

	1. write the code
	2. compile the code

once we compile the code, it will create/generate ".class" file which is real executable for our application or code.

### Note : All my practiced Java code is at "code/java_learning/" in repository
